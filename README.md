High end approach: In this program we attempted to implement features or things similar to the features that are found in TCP. Things such as dealing with acknowledgment packets and ordering as well as reattempting to send packets, are features of TCP that were attempted to be implemented. The 2 programs work in tandem to transmit the files across in a consistent manner and exit gracefully when done. There were many challenges with this program, including getting packet retransmission to be done and done in a timely manner. 

Challenges: Many challenges were faced during the coding of this program. While we feel we had a sound idea logically of what to do, implementing 
those ideas proved to be incredibly challenging. Namely, our biggest challenge was that we were unable to consistently deal with packet dropping as well as
struggled to completely optimize the performance of the program.

Testing: Testing is as described in the project page and files themselves, netsim config, nettest to run,
and a lot of logs. Using the testall function and the logs we tried to track our progress and fix errors/debug.
